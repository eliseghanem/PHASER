# PHASER
PHASER explores the intersection of robotics and music by assisting a human operator in playing a piano piece. It consists of a robotic hand designed to mimic the human joint layout and capable of navigating a stepper-driven rail and playing a piano keyboard alongside a human operator in real-time. The main characteristics of this project are its optimal finger assignment and adaptive response compared to existing complex and user-independent approaches. In terms of applications, the system can be used for educational, entertainment, and assistive purposes as it allows users to learn and practice the instrument in a simplified, engaging, and inclusive way. With its target audience spanning users of all experience levels while accounting for their physical ability to engage in instrument play, PHASERâ€™s principal contribution to the booming field of human-robot collaboration lies in its assistive behavior.
